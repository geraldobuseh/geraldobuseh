# 👋 Gerald Obuseh

Software Engineer operating at the intersection of **systems**, **data**, and **markets**.  
I build things that scale, reason under uncertainty, and compound over time.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus
• Software Engineering with a bias toward **quantitative finance**  
• Numerical analysis, probability, and optimization as first-class tools  
• Designing data pipelines, models, and systems that turn signal into leverage  

---

## 🧠 Technical Stack
**Languages**  
Python · C++ · TypeScript · JavaScript · SQL  

**Foundations**  
Data Structures & Algorithms · Numerical Methods · Probability & Statistics · Linear Algebra  

**Engineering**  
Backend APIs · Distributed systems fundamentals · Performance-aware code  
Version control, testing, and clean abstractions are non-negotiable  

**Quant Toolkit**  
Time-series analysis · Modeling uncertainty · Simulation  
Finance-adjacent data engineering and research workflows  

---

## 📈 What I Build
• Quant-oriented projects that blend math, code, and real data  
• Developer tools and user-facing systems with clean UX and strong internals  
• Experiments where theory meets execution  

Selected work lives in pinned repositories below.

---

## 🎯 Trajectory
I’m optimizing for **depth over noise** and **long-term edge**.  
The goal is simple: become dangerous with fundamentals, then scale impact.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration
Open to collaborating on:
• Quant, finance, or data-heavy engineering projects  
• Systems that reward rigor and curiosity  
• Ideas that ship, learn, and iterate fast
