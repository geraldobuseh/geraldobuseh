# 👋 Gerald Obuseh

Software Engineer operating at the intersection of **systems**, **data**, and **markets**.  

## 🚀 Current Focus
• Software Engineering with a bias toward **quantitative finance**  
• Numerical analysis, probability, and optimization as first-class tools    

## 🧠 Technical Stack
**Languages**  
Python · C++ · TypeScript · JavaScript · SQL  

**Foundations**  
Data Structures & Algorithms · Numerical Methods · Probability & Statistics · Linear Algebra  

**Engineering**  
Backend APIs · Distributed systems fundamentals · Performance-aware code  
Version control, testing, and clean documentation are non-negotiable    

## 📈 What I Build
• Projects that blend math, code, and real data  
• Developer tools and user-facing systems with clean UX and strong internals  
• Experiments where theory meets execution  

## 🎯 Trajectory
I’m optimizing for **depth over noise** and **long-term edge**.  
My goal is very simple: become dangerous with fundamentals, then scale impact.

## 🤝 Collaboration
Open to collaborating on: 
• Systems that reward rigor and curiosity  
• Ideas that ship, learn, and iterate fast
